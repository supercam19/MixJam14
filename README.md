# Death by Drones - MixJam14

Death by Drones is a game I made in 1 week for the MixJam 14 game jam. It notably features procedurally generated dungeons using binary space partitioning, and data (json) driven items and spawntables.

## Description

Clear out procedurally generated dungeons full of enemy drones using your magical wizard powers. Get money from kills in order to unlock chests and gain powerups in order to keep up with scaling enemy difficulty. Take on challenge rooms to receive the strongest powerups in the game.

### Controls:

W/A/S/D = Directional movement

Left Mouse = Magic bolt ability

Right Mouse = Fireball ability (if your browser is trying to open a context menu, the alternative bind is Q)

Space = Dash ability

R = Lightning Strike ability

E = Interact

Escape = Pause / Settings / Ability Info screen
